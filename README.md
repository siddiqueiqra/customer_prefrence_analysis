# Customer Preference Analysis

## Overview

This repository contains the code and analysis for the "Customer Preference Analysis" project. The primary objectives of this project are to analyze the relationship between restaurant characteristics and customer ratings, identify popular cuisines based on votes, and determine if specific cuisines tend to receive higher ratings.

The project is divided into three main tasks:

### Task 1: Data Exploration and Preprocessing

In this task, we perform initial data exploration and preprocessing on the dataset. Key steps include removing irrelevant columns, handling missing values, mapping country codes to country names, and analyzing the distribution of the target variable, "Aggregate rating."

### Task 2: Descriptive Analysis

This task involves a detailed analysis of the data. We calculate statistical measures, identify top cuisines and cities with the highest number of restaurants, and explore relationships between categorical variables such as online delivery, table booking, and rating categories.

### Task 3: GeoSpatial Analysis

In the final task, we conduct geospatial analysis to visualize restaurant locations on a map using longitude and latitude data. We analyze the distribution of restaurants across different cities and countries and investigate the correlation between restaurant location and aggregate ratings.
